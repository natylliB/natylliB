# Hey 👋 My name is Billy Tan

I'm Indonesian, live in a small Island Batam.

Closest neighboring countries Singapore (45 minutes) and Malaysia (1 hour) ferry rides.

I'm currently trying to build my portofolio in GitHub, trying my best to get into tech world!
I aspire to be a full-stack web developer, 👀 guidances from kindhearted seniors are **_super duper_** appreciated!

As of now, my repos consist of my submissions form the courses I have completed.

If you up for us to get known each other, please follow my [LinkedIn Account](linkedin.com/in/billy-tan-0ba29a7a).

Kinds Regards ♥️

Billy.
