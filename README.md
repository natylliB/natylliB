# Hey Ladies and Gentlemen 👋

My name is **Billy Tan**.<br>

I'm currently trying to build my portofolio in GitHub, trying my best to get into tech world!
I aspire to be a full-stack web developer, 👀 guidances from kindhearted seniors are super duper appreciated.

As of now, my repos consist of my submissions form the courses I have completed.

If you up for us to get known each other, please follow my [LinkedIn Account](linkedin.com/in/billy-tan-0ba29a7a).

Kinds Regards ♥️

Billy.
